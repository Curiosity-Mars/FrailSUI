### Extended Description:
This script generates two visualizations:

1. **Figure 1a**: A bar plot showing the prevalence of Stress Urinary Incontinence (SUI) among frail and non-frail groups.
   - The x-axis represents frailty status (Non-Frail vs. Frail).
   - The y-axis represents the prevalence rate of SUI.
   - Percentage labels are added to each bar for clarity.

2. **Figure 1b**: A forest plot illustrating the odds ratios for predicting SUI based on multiple factors.
   - The x-axis shows the odds ratios.
   - The y-axis lists predictor variables, including BMI quartiles, age quartiles, marital status, education level, race, and frailty status.
   - Confidence intervals are represented by error bars.
   - A red dashed line is placed at an odds ratio of 1 for reference.

These figures provide insight into the relationship between frailty and SUI and the relative importance of different predictors in estimating SUI risk.
